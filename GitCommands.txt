. Process of Commiting

Make change
git status
git add changedfilename/.
git commit -m "provide message for a change"
git log //see the commits

. To stash or save the changes without commiting 

Make change
git status
git add changedfilename/.
git stash

. To host your project on github (Add first Changes)

git remote add origin repourl //to connect the repo to the project
git remote -v //to see connected url's
git push origin master(branch name) //push the files to repo

. To Do a contribution or pull request on github

Fork the repository
clone it
check status
git status
add upstream(project to which you want to contribute) url bY: git remote add upstream upstreamurl
create a new branch
git branch newbranch
git checkout newbranch(head will point to that branch)
make changes to files 
add the changes
git add .
git commit -m "message"
after commiting make a pull request
(make sure that for each pull request you have to create a new branch)

. To maintain your forked directory and the main project's commits that you have made


git fetch --all --prune
git reset --hard upstram/main (reset main branch of origin to main branch of upstream)
git push origin main

WE CAN ALSO USE 
git pull upstream main
git push origin main


. Squashing or merging multiple commits
